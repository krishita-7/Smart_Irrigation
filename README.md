# Smart_Irrigation
In India, where 60-70% of economy depends on agriculture, there is a great need to modernize the conventional agricultural practices for the better productivity. 
Agriculture is one of the fields where water is required in tremendous quantity. Wastage of water is the major problem in agriculture. 
So, to overcome this problem Smart Irrigation is the best solution. With which the use of water will be in appropriate amount, without any human intervention. 
With the use of NodeRed, NodeMCU, temp and humidity sensors we have built a smart irrigation system which automatically turns on and off the water pump according to the weather.
First of all system will sense the humidity and temperature.The smart irrigation system uses temperature and humidity Sensor to measure the relative parameter in order to 
give the water to crops If the humidity and temperature is beyond our threshold value . Then it will turn on the water pump and the crops will ge watered. 
If it is less than the threshold value then there is no need to turn on the water pump.
Also to mention that we have used ibm watson platform to add device of ibm iot sensor which acts as input sensors to our project.
We have uploaded a demonstration video on YouTube, link is provided here: https://youtu.be/zbLsYwwxFOg
